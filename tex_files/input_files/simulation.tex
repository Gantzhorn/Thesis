For the simulations we use the so-called Scalar-weak order 2.0 It√¥-Taylor method \cite[algorithm 8.5]{Srkk2019}. Apart from this, detalis on how the simulations are carried out, can be found in section \ref{appendix:simMethods} in the appendix. The schemes that we derive are shown in equations (\ref{eq:OUSim} - \ref{eq:jacobiDiffusion})
