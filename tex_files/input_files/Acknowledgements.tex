I would like to express my gratitude towards my supervisor, Susanne Ditlevsen, for her guidance and encouragement throughout the course of this thesis. I would also like to thank Predrag Pilipovic for introducing me to stochastic differential equations. Without their expertise my knowledge about this field of statistics would be void. Also, I owe them huge thanks for reigniting my passion for doing statistics as a whole.\\\\
I would also like to say thank you to my colleagues at P+, especially in Udvikling, for their support and encouragement during this process. A special thanks to William and Martin for their understanding and flexibility during my writing of this thesis.\\\\
I would like to extend a thanks to my study group: Andreas, Lucas and Mads. Thanks for many great moments and interesting talks over the last 5 years. \\\\
I am deeply grateful to my parents for supporting me in not only my studies, but also in all my endeavors. I owe them and my siblings, Ebbe and Astrid, enormous gratitude for creating such a supportive environment. Thanks for all the great memories together.\\\\
Finally, and most importantly, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Martine for her unconditional love and support. Thanks for bearing over with me when times were tough during these 4 months and thanks for being there throughout the last 5 years. It has been invaluable.
